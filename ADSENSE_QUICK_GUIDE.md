# üéØ Google AdSense - Quick Setup

## Why You See Empty Spaces?

Your Google AdSense is **not configured yet**. The code is showing placeholder boxes instead of real ads.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Show Placeholder Ads (Current - No Setup Needed)
The gray boxes with "‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶û‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶® ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®" will show until you configure AdSense.

### Option 2: Setup Real Google Ads

#### Step 1: Get AdSense Account
1. Visit: https://www.google.com/adsense/
2. Sign up with your Google account
3. Add your website: `www.easterninsight.net`
4. Wait for approval (1-3 days)

#### Step 2: Get Your Publisher ID
After approval, you'll get a Publisher ID like:
```
ca-pub-1234567890123456
```

#### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables
Open `.env.local` and add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-1234567890123456
```

#### Step 4: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Done!** Real ads will now show instead of placeholders.

## üí° Tips

### For Testing (Before AdSense Approval)
The placeholder ads are fine for development. They show where ads will appear.

### After AdSense Approval
1. Add your Publisher ID to `.env.local`
2. Real ads will show automatically
3. No code changes needed!

### For Production
Add the same environment variable in your hosting platform:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-your-actual-id
```

## üö´ Common Issues

### "I added the ID but still see placeholders"
- Did you restart the server? (`npm run dev`)
- Check the ID format: must start with `ca-pub-`
- Check for typos in the ID

### "Ads show blank spaces"
- New AdSense accounts take 24-48 hours to serve ads
- Make sure your site is live and accessible
- Check AdSense dashboard for any policy violations

### "I don't have AdSense yet"
- Keep the placeholders for now
- Apply for AdSense when your site has good content
- Requirements: Original content, good traffic, policy compliance

## üìù Current Configuration

# Google AdSense (ADD THIS)
