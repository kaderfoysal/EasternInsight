# Video Detail Page Production Fix

## Problem
The video detail page was working locally but not in production.

## Root Cause
The video detail page was directly connecting to MongoDB using `dbConnect()` and the `Video` model, which can cause issues in production environments due to:
1. Server-side rendering complications
2. Database connection timeouts
3. Missing runtime configuration

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Dedicated API Route
**File:** `app/api/videos/[id]/route.ts`
- New API endpoint for fetching individual videos
- Follows the same pattern as the news API (`/api/news/[id]`)
- Handles database connection properly
- Includes view count increment
- Proper error handling

### 2. Updated Video Detail Page
**File:** `app/video/[id]/page.tsx`

#### Changes:
- **Removed direct database access** - No longer imports `dbConnect` or `Video` model
- **Uses API route instead** - Fetches data via `/api/videos/${id}`
- **Added runtime configuration**:
  ```typescript
  export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
  export const revalidate = 0;
  ```
- **Improved error handling** - Better logging for production debugging
- **Made mobile responsive** - Added responsive classes throughout

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
- Responsive padding: `px-2 sm:px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Responsive text sizes: `text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-4xl`
- Responsive spacing throughout
- Better touch targets for mobile
- Optimized video embed for mobile viewing

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your production environment:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
# OR
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Video detail page loads correctly
- [ ] YouTube videos embed properly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] View count increments

### Production Testing
- [ ] Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly
- [ ] Test video detail page with valid video ID
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify API route is accessible: `https://your-domain.com/api/videos/[video-id]`
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Check database connection logs

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix video detail page for production and improve mobile responsiveness"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables** in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

3. **Redeploy** the application

4. **Test** the video detail page in production

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: API returns 404
**Solution:** Ensure the video ID is valid and the video is published

### Issue: "Failed to fetch video"
**Solution:** Check that `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable is set correctly in production

### Issue: Database connection timeout
**Solution:** Verify MongoDB connection string and network access settings

### Issue: Page shows 500 error
**Solution:** Check production logs for detailed error messages

## API Endpoints

### Get Single Video
```
GET /api/videos/[id]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "video": {
    "_id": "...",
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "youtubeVideoId": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "createdAt": "..."
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/video/[id]/page.tsx` - Video detail page (refactored)
2. `app/api/videos/[id]/route.ts` - New API route (created)

## Benefits

✅ **Production-ready** - Proper API architecture
✅ **Better error handling** - Easier to debug issues
✅ **Mobile responsive** - Works great on all devices
✅ **Consistent architecture** - Matches news detail page pattern
✅ **Scalable** - Can handle production traffic
✅ **SEO-friendly** - Proper metadata generation
